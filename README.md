# COVID-19-Personal-Awarness
Datavis Class Project in javascript and D3 which simulates the impact of personal precautions on disease spread.


* We created our final project in an observable notebook. The experience and the code can be found in that [link](https://observablehq.com/@nouran-soliman/covid-19-personal-awareness-datavis-game/5).
* The presentation video can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vudc23l4v1dvixc/COVID-19%20Personal%20Awareness-Final%20Presentation%20Video.mp4?dl=0).
* The presentation slides can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b7cb0br4bft71re/COVID-19%20Personal%20Awareness-Final%20Presentation.pdf?dl=0).

# Work Distribution
Nouran worked on the project backend (simulation model and code structure). Dishita worked on the front end (visualizations). Both of us worked on combining the front and back ends, the report and the presentation. 

# Commentery on Work Process
Initially, we thought about creating a basic zoomable map visualization that tracks the user movements over different scopes: state, city, etc. After discussions with TAs, we were inspired to use a more creative approach (gamified narrative) to raise awareness.

We chose to work with observable notebooks because of the d3 interactive animations availability and online accessibility (easily shared with others.) 

The detailed work process and design decisions are explained in our paper.
